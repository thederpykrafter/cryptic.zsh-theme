# cryptic.zsh-theme

I used [aphrodite-terminal-theme](https://github.com/win0err/aphrodite-terminal-theme) as a starting point for this theme.

The one charachter gap on the right side is to make resized windows look cleaner. However it still may not update properly with some desktope environments.

```bash
git clone --quiet https://github.com/thederpykrafter/cryptic.zsh-theme.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/
```

> Tux(Penguin) is not part of this theme. It is part of my [zsh config](https://github.com/thederpykrafter/zsh)
